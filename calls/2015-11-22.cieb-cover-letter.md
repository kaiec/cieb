Dear members of the LD4PE Competency Index Editorial Board,

We are making good progress on the Competency Index.  The Topic Index which
we approved on last month's call has now been integrated with all of the
existing competencies and benchmarks from the CI [1].  Henceforth we will
record all of our decisions in this file. (To avoid confusion, I have marked
some of the previous files as obsolete, with a pointer to [1].)

The agenda for our call on this coming Friday, 27 November (at 16:00 Berlin
time):

1. Finalize the set of competencies related to SPARQL [1]. This will be our 
   priority - even if it takes the entire call - so please review the
   competencies carefully.  On the other hand, there has not been much discussion
   of these since the last call, so we anticipate that this is merely a
   formality at this point.  If anyone does have further comments on these
   competencies, please post them before the next meeting.

2. Discuss draft competencies related to one area of SPARQL that we have not 
   addressed yet: CRUD (create, read, update, delete) operations.  Sean has put 
   together a list of related resources and split them up so that each of us 
   has several to look to prepare for Friday.  Recall that we only need to 
   review the materials enough to allow us to formulate draft competency 
   statements.  The assignments are attached below.  Please formulate a few 
   competencies based on your reading of the assignments and put them into 
   the document on Github [2].

3. Time permitting, we will take a first look at resources in the next area 
   of the Competency Index -- "Fundamentals of Resource Description Framework".  
   Sean has also put together relevant resources for review in this area [3].
   Our goal on the call will be to discuss how to go about formulating 
   competencies in this very general area.

SPARQL/CRUD Assignments

It was difficult to find learning resources devoted solely to the topic of
CRUD operations using SPARQL, so some of these resources only have a few
slides/pages/paragraphs which are relevant.   A few of them only approach
the topic tangentially, but hopefully we can glean some competencies from
them anyway.
