Review of the Subject Vocabulary (Topic Index)

* As originally posted

    * https://github.com/ld4pe/cieb/blob/master/TopicIndex/LD4PE-TopicVocab-v2.txt

* Tom's proposed revision

    * https://github.com/ld4pe/cieb/blob/master/TopicIndex/LD4PE-TopicVocab-v2-tb.txt

* Questions to ask

    * Are the topics sufficient to provide a home for our competencies?
    * Do you see gaps?

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Future calls

* Top priority: return to competencies

  * https://github.com/ld4pe/cieb/blob/master/calls/Competencies.md
  * Put your initials, in brackets, after any edits you may want to make. [tb]
  * Post your comments to list or bring them to the next call.

* Clarification in parallel

  * Clarify editorial workflow: should we start to edit the
    [Turtle representation](https://github.com/ld4pe/cieb/blob/master/CompIndex/CompIndex.ttl)
    directly and generate a more reader-friendly document such as 
    [our current competencies draft](https://github.com/ld4pe/cieb/blob/master/calls/Competencies.md),
    or should we do it the other way around -- i.e., generate Turtle 
    from some text representation?

  * Do we need to distinguish between a "stage" version and a "publication"
    version of the Turtle document?

  * Solicit feedback on our (reader-friendly) competency draft from experts.
