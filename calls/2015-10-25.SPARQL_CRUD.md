Put together this list of SPARQL and CRUD related resources for review before the next call, in line with the "Next Step": 
  "Continue to refine SPARQL with goal of finalizing on next call. Attention to competencies with CRUD".

##SPARQL and CRUD Resources
**These existing resources were the only ones that seemed worth revisiting:**

SPARQL by Example

NOTE: You have to arrow key through the slides; relevant section is about 3/4 of the way through the presentation.

SPARQL 1.1
http://www.slideshare.net/andyseaborne/sparql-11-update?next_slideshow=1

SPARQL Cheat Sheet
http://www.slideshare.net/LeeFeigenbaum/sparql-cheat-sheet?next_slideshow=1
NOTE: Only one slide (#17) covers relevant topics.

--------------------------

**ADDITIONAL NOTES:**

Several resources I reviewed were “possibly relevant”, but only if we consider SPARQL “CONSTRUCT” to be similar to “Create”. 
My opinion is that although some resources refer to CONSTRUCT as “creating” a new RDF graph, the actual W3C recommendation[1]
states that: “The CONSTRUCT query form returns a single RDF graph specified by a graph template”. So, it is really just an 
alternative query form to SELECT and shouldn’t be considered alongside the UPDATE requests added in SPARQL 1.1.

ALSO: The following presentation was overlooked when I was selecting resources for the CIEB to look over.  It looks to me 
like it has some good material on a few areas we may not have covered yet (such as “accessing SPARQL endpoints”, “federated 
query processing”, and “linked traversal based query execution”).
