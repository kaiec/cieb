Missing: History of SPARQL and/or RDF, standardization process.
Missing: JSON-LD, maybe all serializations as benchmark?
* Under [B] RDF serialization?

* [D] Uses aggregates to apply expressions over groups of solutions
                (GROUP BY, COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN) for partitioning results,
* [D] Uses the GROUP BY clause to transforms a result set so that only
                one row will appear for each unique set of grouping variables 
* [D] Uses the HAVING clause to apply a filter to the result set after
                grouping
* [D] Uses NOT EXISTS to limit whether a given graph pattern exists in
                the data
* [C] Understands the role of Property Paths and how they are formed by
            combining predicates with regular expression-like operators
* [C] Understands the SPARQL Graph Store HTTP protocol for editing 
            graphs on remote servers

Missing as [D]: DELETE, INSERT, DELETE-INSERT, 

----------------------------------------------------------------------
https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-http-rdf-update/ - "SPARQL 1.1 Graph Store HTTP Protocol"

Under [B] Manipulating RDF Data?

  * [C] Knows the SPARQL Graph Store HTTP Protocol for editing graphs on remote servers
  * [C] Uses SPARQL for inserting, deleting, modifying RDF data

*  Access Control for HTTP Operations on Linked Data
   http://eswc-conferences.org/sites/default/files/papers2013/costabello.pdf

None of the competencies from the index apply in my opinion. Could someone please check if I understand something wrong?

[C] Knows about measures for securing access to data and APIs

======================================================================
Sean

[C] Understands SPARQL/CRUD's relationship to HTTP methods (added by Debbie)

[C] Understands that SPARQL 1.1 allows one not just to QUERY data in a collection, but also to add to, delete from and update that data (i.e. it is not just a query language, but an update language). 

[D] Uses a SPARQL server (such as as Fuseki) to interact with a triplestore via a web form and/or HTTP requests. 
   
[C] Understands that the SPARQL Update specification calls for the term “update request” to be used in place of “query”.

[D] Uses “a” as a shorthand for the URI <http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#type>.
   
[D] Uses the extension “.ru” for files storing SPARQL Update requests.
   
---------------------------

[C] Understands that INSERT DATA and INSERT are used to add data to a collection.

[C] Understands that INSERT DATA cannot include a WHERE clause and can only uses specific triples to add data- which is faster for the SPARQL processor and is considered best practice when patterns are necessary for the added data.

[C] Understands that INSERT includes a WHERE clause and allows one to use triple patterns- but is slower for the SPARQL processor. 

[D] Uses the SPARQL LOAD operation to load an entire web-accessible dataset at once.
   
[D] Uses CREATE GRAPH to create an empty graph.
   
---------------------------

[C] Understands that DELETE DATA and INSERT DELETE are used to remove data to a collection.

[C] Understands that DELETE DATA corresponds to INSERT DATA and only allows the use of specific triples to delete data.

[C] Understands that DELETE corresponds to INSERT and allows one to use triple patterns.

[D] Uses DELETE WHERE as a shortcut to delete any triples matched in the WHERE graph pattern.

[D] Uses the CLEAR command to clear all triples from a default graph.
   
---------------------------

[C] Understands that changes to existing triples are performed as a delete operation followed by an insert operation, which is referred to as an "INSERT/DELETE" update request.

[D] Uses a CONSTRUCT query to preview changes which will be made before executing an INSERT/DELETE update request.

[D] Uses semicolons to connect multiple operations in update requests.
   
---------------------------

[C] Understands that inserting triples into a named graph which does not exist will result in the SPARQL Processor creating that graph. 

[C] Understands that the use of INSERT DATA vs INSERT with a WHERE clause is the same with named graphs as it si when working with default graphs.

---------------------------

[C] Understands the difference between DELETE (removes triples) and DROP (removes graphs).

[C] Understands that a dropped default graph still exists, but is now empty.

[D] Uses DROP to delete a graph from a dataset. 

[D] Uses DROP DEFAULT to clear the default graph. 

[C] Understands that SPARQL Update offers no UNDO operation before deleting graphs. 

[D] Uses DROP ALL to drop the default graph and all named graphs.

[C] Understands that DROP removes complete graphs and CLEAR removes triples from within graphs, leaving an empty graph.

---------------------------

[C] Understands that the use of DELETE DATA vs DELETE with a WHERE clause is the same as when working with default graphs, except that     the graph must now be named. 

[D] Uses CLEAR followed by the name of a specific graph to clear all triples from a named graph.
	
[D] Uses CLEAR NAMED to clear all triples from all named graphs.
	
[D] Uses CLEAR ALL to clear all triples from all named graphs and the default graph.
	
---------------------------
	
[D] Uses WITH as a shortcut when working with named graphs to avoid using the name of a graph in the remainder of the update              request (makes it less verbose when performing multiple operations).

[C] Understands that WITH does not work with INSERT DATA, so INSERT with a WHERE clause must be used instead.

[D] Uses USING to specify a graph that a WHERE clause should look at (similar to FROM and SELECT).

[D] Uses caution when combing WITH and USING to avoid confusion as to which part of the update each refers.

[D] Uses USING NAMED to specify a graph that will be referenced by name (similar to FROM NAMED and SELECT).
   
---------------------------

[C] Understands that COPY and MOVE operations allow one to copy and move triples between named graphs and between the default graph and a named graph.

[D] Uses COPY to copy triples from one graph into another, replacing any existing triples in the destination graph. 

[D] Uses MOVE to move triples from one graph into another, replacing any existing triples in the destination graph. 

---------------------------

*  RDFAlchemy
   http://www.openvest.com/trac/wiki/RDFAlchemy


[D] Uses the properties of object-oriented programming languages (such as Python) to create APIs (such as RDFAlchemy) which provide access to RDF triplestores.

[D] Uses APIs (such as RDFAlchemy) to map between data located in relational databases and a SPARQL endpoint.

[C] Understands that descriptors can be used to  binds an instance variable to the calls to the RDF backend storage.

[D] Uses rdflib Descriptors to define classes, implemt caching, then passes the predicate in to create objects which can be used to perform CRUD operations.

[C] Understands that descriptors can be pulled from either an RDF triplestore or a relational database (via sister tool SQLAlchemy), allowing one to mix and match SQL, rdflib and SPARQL data.

---------------------------

*  Simple example of manipulating graph data using SPARQL Update
   https://anandavala.wordpress.com/2013/06/02/sparql-update-example-code-for-create-insert-delete-edit/

[C]  Understands that  a programming language (such as Java) can be used to interact with an API (such as Apache Jena) and perform CRUD operations.

[D] Writes a main function to implement the application logic using SPARQL commands expressed as strings.

[D] Uses helper functions to access the graph store.

__Kai__: Indexed with competencies we have right now. General SPARQL 101 slides.
Found we do not have INSERT, DELETE operations.  Suggest we include JSON-LD as
a benchmark.  Serialization format only right now but deserves more
representation.

__Debbie__: I agree. Anything from schema.org is important to mention I would
think.

[Magnus, Debbie, Stuart report serious Skype problems -- either hear nothing,
or lots of static. Tom hangs up and Magnus initiates the call.]

__Kai__: As for the second resource I reviewed: a walk-through, not very good blog
post.  Graph store protocol should be http protocol.

__Kai__: POST GET DELETE with graph store.  Changing -- with SPARQL 1.1 directly.
Is a different set of competencies.

__Debbie__: HTTP distinction is good; I tried to bring that up too.

__Kai__: Would also switch order.  SPARQL first, then HTTP.


__Kai__: Very important point to distinguish the two ways to update.  Shouldn't be
mixed.

__Tom__: Would like to slightly reword for clarity -- for someone who is reading
with little background.

__Kai__: Add something like [reference to] REST.

__Tom__: Capture without using jargon.

__Kai__: Would like to see more about history of SPARQL and standardization
process. How it evolved.  May be helpful to add context?

__Stuart__: Up in the Fundamentals section?

__Magnus__: As for my competencies - similar to Kai.  Need to separate SPARQL part
and RESTful API part.  The second resource is a research paper.  What sort of
competencies could be gained from reading this?
