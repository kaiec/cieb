>> START SEAN'S 9/22 CONTRIBUTION 

======================================================================
2015-09-22

As discussed at the end of the 2015-09-18 call, I took all the competency suggestions and grouped them topically.  Put lines dividing what I thought were logical clusterings. Also eliminated all references to the specific resources that inspired the suggestions.  Tried to classify each suggestion as either a competency or benchmark, based on our discussion ("understanding" a concept for the former, "performing an action" for the latter).  Finally, put everything in a standard format.  Hopefully this will make the process of wordsmithing the competencies into a "more final" version easier. ---Sean
