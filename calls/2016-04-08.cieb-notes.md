under "Querying RDF".

__ACTION 2016-04-08__: Kai and Magnus (not on the call) to comment on

======================================================================
Review of Competency Index

__Tom__: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1i1k5kZLWncb3dJozb61SQiRS7hljUAox-gEXs4gHs7o
This Google doc from January has been "frozen".  
   
__Tom__: In general, I find a Google doc is more a place for people to post
competencies in the margins than for suggesting competencies (especially large
groups of competencies).

__Sean__: Where is the appropriate place to do this?

__Tom__: Two possible mechanisms:

1. Discuss proposed competencies through JISC mail (as separate threads for
   each topic, but released just two threads at a time to avoid overwhelming 
   people).

2. Github:
  * On staging document to edit (through pull requests) - or...
  * Issue Tracker.

__ACTION__: Tom to re-watch Richard Wallis's DCMI webinar of GitHub process.
[Note after call: process is described in
http://dataliberate.com/2016/03/01/evolving-schema-org-in-practice-pt3-choosing-where-to-extend/)

__ACTION 2016-04-08__: Tom to get the ball rolling for per-topic competency threads
on all topics on today's agenda that we did not have time to discuss -- first on 
dc-review then later, possibly, on Github.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
A Fundamentals of Resource Description Framework 

*  Identity in RDF 
  * __Understands that a "real-world" thing may need to be named with a URI separate from the URI for
    a description of that thing__
  * __Recognizes that URI names are "owned" by the respective owners of the Internet domain name.__

__DECISION__: Thumbs up from call participants for proposed competencies.

__GAP__: Under "Storing": difference between relational DB and triplestore (as 
suggested by Wellywood Staplegun aka "Mr DC").

*  Related data models
  * __GAP: competency about difference between RDF and object-oriented class models__

__Stuart__: An important one that Karen has articulated as well.  

__ACTION 2016-04-08__: Under "Identity in RDF, Tom to draft competency about
object-oriented / RDF distinction."

----------------------------------------------------------------------
A Fundamentals of Linked Data

*  Web technology

__Tom__: Stuart, okay to add definitions for topics?

__Stuart__: Yes.  Technically, two ways: 
* SKOS file that will hopefully grow - we could use skos:scopeNote or skos:definition.
* In the competency framework itself, nothing to stop us from adding a comment.
So in practical terms, you could make a scopeNote or definition, then let me know and 
I will plug it in.

__Tom__: Debbie?

__Debbie__: Yes, can propose competencies.

__ACTION 2016-04-08__: Under "Web technology", Debbie to propose competencies
about basic Web technology -- 1) HTML, 2) HTTP, 3) REST, 4) URI schemes -- then
write a brief definition for the topic "Web technology" in order to make clear
to users that this is about the principles and mechanics of the Web that
underlie Linked Data.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Point about RDFa

Sean proposed:

* __Understands that RDFa is a way to express RDF data within HTML, in a way
  that is machine-readable, and by reusing the existing human-readable data
  in the document.__ etc etc

__Tom__: I propose moving these to "RDF serialization".

__ACTION 2016-04-08__: Tom to move Sean's point about RDFa under "RDF
serialization" and push to dc-review or Github issue tracker.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Linked data principles

Tom proposed:

* __Knows Tim Berners-Lee's principles of Linked Data: use URIs to name things, use HTTP URIs 
  that can be resolved to useful information, and create links to URIs of other things.__
* __Knows the "five stars" of Open Data: put data on the Web, preferably in a structured and 
  preferably non-proprietary format, using URIs to name things, and linking to other data.__

__ACTION 2016-04-08__: Tom to propose two points under "Linked data principles"
on dc-review or Github issue tracker.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Linked Data architectures and services

After some discussion of how to define this topic, consensus seemed to 
favor dropping the topic entirely.

__Tom__: I do not know what a "Linked Data architecture or service" is if not,
on the one hand, content negotiation or, on the other, applications -- both of
which are covered elsewhere in the Competency Index.

__Sean__: Proposed some competencies, starting with: __Understands Linked Data
query processing is a special case of federated query processing with special
challenges caused by the highly distributed structure and evolving nature of
Linked Data__.  Extracted these from one particular source.

__Tom__: These are too fine-grained.  

__Stuart__: Move to "Querying RDF"?

__Tom__: Maybe (just one) competency about "federated" query?  Not convinced.

__Stuart__: CI must function, in part, as a cataloging tool.  You 
find a relevant resource.  Is there an appropriate place to put it?

__ACTION 2016-04-08__: Kai and Magnus (not on the call) to comment on
whether competencies related to federated query processing are needed
under "Querying RDF".

__ACTION 2016-04-08__: Kai and Magnus (not on the call) to comment on
whether "Linked Data architectures and services" really needs to be a 
separate topic (and with what content?) -- given that "content negotiation"
and "applications" are covered elsewhere -- or dropped entirely.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Non-RDF Linked Data

__Tom__: Candidate for deletion pending response from Marjie Hlava?  In earlier
discussion, she emphasized need for this topic but may have different position
today.  Wrote to ask her advice.  But where to put Schema.org and Microdata?

__ACTION 2016-04-08__: As a replacement for the heading "Non-RDF Linked Data",
Tom to propose competencies about the RDF-compatible model for Schema.org, and
its serialization syntax, microdata.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
A RDF vocabularies and application profiles
*  Finding RDF-based vocabularies
  * Retrieves and accesses RDF data from the "open Web"

__Tom__: This benchmark seems out of place?  Maybe a benchmark about using LOV
to look up a vocabulary? [Note after call: We already have a benchmark: "Uses
portals and registries to find existing RDF-based vocabularies".

__Sean__: This is a simple mistake -- point is repeated under 
"RDF Data" below.

__ACTION 2016-04-08__: Tom to fix redundant point about "retrieving data" 
under "Finding RDF-based vocabularies"

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Managing identifiers

Sean proposed:

* __Understands the principle of persistence, i.e. that a URI is permanently
  assigned to a particular resource, is stable, and does not change or vanish
  over time.__
  * __Avoids including version numbers and status information in URIs__
  * __Exercises caution when using auto-increment for minting new URIs__
  * __Avoids using query strings in URIs__
  * __Avoids using organization names in URIs__
  * __Avoids using file extensions in URIs__

__Tom__: Would prefer to merge individual items into one summary
competency.

__Stuart__: Agree, through there are good reasons to leave
benchmarks enumerated.

__Sean__: Would not have a problem with the competencies I proposed 
being made broader and less detailed.

__ACTION 2016-04-08__: Tom to push Sean's points re: "Managing URIs"
together with a competency about "namespace policies".

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Designing RDF-based vocabularies

Sean proposed:

  * __Understands that OWL (Web Ontology Language) is a more expressive option
    for data modeling and reasoning than RDFS.__
    * __Understands that OWL allows one to describe data in terms of set operations
      (e.g. unionOf).__
    * __Understands that OWL allows one to define equivalences across datasets
      (e.g. sameAs).__
    * __Understands that OWL allows one to restrict property values (e.g.
      allValesFrom).__
    * __Uses OWL annotations (e.g., owl:versionInfo, owl:backwardsCompatibleWith,
      owl:deprecatedProperty) to express relationships between different
      ontologies.__
  * __Understands that Simple Knowledge Organization System (SKOS) is a simpler
    alternative to RDFS and OWL suitable for tasks such as describing
    controlled vocabularies.__
  * __Uses classes to describe concepts (loosely defined as "ideas"), concept
    collections, and concept schemes.__
    * __Uses properties (e.g., skos:exactMatch, skos: broader, and skos:narrower)
      to map between separate vocabularies.  [or put under "Mapping RDF vocabularies"?]__

__Tom__: The OWL competencies go into too much detail.  I already 
have an ACTION to write competencies for SKOS.

__Sean__: OWL should be worked into the CI somewhere - feels like it is 
not represented currently.

__Stuart__: Cannot teach RDF without mentioning OWL. May come up elsewhere in
CI -- e.g., sameAs issue under "mapping".

__ACTION 2016-04-08__: Tom to push Sean's OWL competencies (under "RDF
Vocabularies" ) in addition to his own competencies for SKOS.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
*  Mapping RDF vocabularies

__ACTION 2016-04-08__: Tom to propose competencies under "Mapping RDF
vocabularies" re: SKOS mapping properties, other predicates
(owl:equivalentXXX), and the controversial owl:sameAs.

======================================================================

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Contacting resource authors about commenting on CI

__Tom__: On the February 19 call, we discussed the idea of writing to the some of the
authors of resources indexed by LD4PE, saying (roughly) "we indexed your video
X using the competencies Y and Z" and asking them to comment on the Competency
Index.  See: 
https://github.com/ld4pe/cieb/blob/master/calls/2016-03-11.resource_creators_v2.docx

__Stuart__: It is worth contacting authors, if only to draw attention to our
work.

__ACTION 2016-04-08__: Sean to attempt to identify individuals who worked on
EuCLID.
