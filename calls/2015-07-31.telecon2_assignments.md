*  Using SPARQL to visualize linked data   
   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uR_7UkHs0zA

COMPETENCY: Is able to retrieve and access RDF data from the “open web”.  

EXAMPLE: You can’t just open an RDF file with MS WORD; you need a text editor that supports the .rdf file extension.

--------------

COMPETENCY:  Is able to use RDF output to discern semantic relationships which can then be used to form SPARQL queries.

EXAMPLE:  Episode of TV show which is categorized as belonging to multiple genres (entertainment, comedy, satire).  This resource can be used to show relationship between the entertainment and satire categories. Say the user wants to  write a SPARQL query which discovers similar relationships (all the pairs of genres which have been co-tagged to a particular episode).  The individual would need to know how to get the RDF data from the website and interpret it as well as how to form queries from it using syntax like:  rdfs:label  ?categoryLabel and rdfs:label  ?relatedLabel .

--------------

COMPETENCY: Writes SPARQL queries with a mind towards how the results will display relationships and provide a useful visualization of those relationships. 

EXAMPLE: Same case as above.  Which to SELECT?  Whether to use DISTINCT or other operators to limit results? How to ORDER them?  

--------------

COMPETENCY: Uses additional tools to create more impactful visualizations for one’s audience.   NOTE:  Moowheel (the tool shown in this video) uses JSON output, which requires only “trivial code” to map from the SPARQL endpoint’s results output.

--------------

COMPETENCY: If necessary, is able to convert/manipulate SPARQL query outputs (RDF-XML, JSON) to the exact format required by a third party tool/API. See above.

--------------

COMPETENCY: Is able to take large datasets and distill results so that visualizations are human-friendly and relationships are comprehendible.

EXAMPLE: Taking all the BBC programs from all BBC channels and all of the genre relationships between them creates a wheel that is far to cluttered visually to be useful to a human being. Solution: create multiple graphs/charts/etc. to break the data into manageable pieces (such as one wheel for each BBC station).  Doing so actually allows new information to emerge- such as which BBC stations broadcast which types of programming.  

NOTE:  This competency falls under topics other than SPARQL/Searching RDF, such as “Interacting with Linked Data” and its subtopic- “Visualization tools and techniques”.  

--------------

*  SPARQL Cheat Sheet  
   http://www.slideshare.net/LeeFeigenbaum/sparql-cheat-sheet?next_slideshow=1

COMPETENCY: Understands the purpose/use of each of the four SPARQL query forms and what type of results one will receive from them.  Example: ASK determines whether or not there are any matches and returns either “true” or “false”. SEE Slide 6. 

--------------

COMPETENCY: Knows how/when to combine SPARQL graph patterns using operators such as OPTIONAL, UNION, MINUS. SEE Slide 7 + 8.

--------------

COMPETENCY: Uses SPARQL filters to eliminate solutions that do not cause an expression to evaluate to true. SEE Slide 10.

--------------

COMPETENCY: Places filters in a query inline within a basic graph pattern. SEE Slide 10.

--------------

COMPETENCY: Understands the use of Aggregates (COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN)  for partitioning results, evaluating projections, and filtering results. SEE Slide 12.

--------------

COMPETENCY: Understands the role of Property Paths and how to form them by combining predicates with regular expression-like operators.  SEE Slide 13.

--------------

COMPETENCY: Understands the difference between a Default Graph and a Named Graph, and the use of the GRAPH clause in queries.  SEE Slide 14.

--------------

COMPETENCY:  Understands SPARQL over HTTP, the use of GET and POST, and that graphs given in the protocol override graphs given in the query.  SEE Slide 15.

--------------

COMPETENCYy: Uses Federated Query to query over a Local Graph Store and one or more other SERVICES (SPARQL endpoints). 
SEE Slide 16.  

NOTE: This one especially very likely needs re-wording.

--------------

*  Linked data and SPARQL queries tutorial  http://www.vivoweb.org/files/presentations/12ws7/Tutorial_Section_1.pdf

COMPETENCY: Uses relevant resources to discover existing Linked Data datasets. Example:  Datahub, which uses CKAN and links to the Linked Open Data Cloud. 

NOTE: Falls under “Discovery of RDF vocabularies and datasets”

--------------

COMPETENCY: Uses W3C Guidelines for Collecting Metadata on Linked Datasets when registering datasets with relevant services: Datahub/Linked Open Data Cloud.  
 
NOTE: Falls under “Describing RDF resources for discovery”.  Current competency mentions registering with “relevant services”- should we tell the user what those services are?

--------------

COMPETENCY: Monitors and updates lists which report the status of SPARQL endpoints.  Examples:  W3C’s SparqlEndpoints page, Vienna University (http://sparqles.ai.wu.ac.at/availability), Mondeca (http://sparqles.ai.wu.ac.at/).

--------------

COMPETENCY: Is able to figure out how data are structured (for instance what types of resources are available (classes) and what properties relate the resources of each type) in order to write a query.

--------------

COMPETENCY: Is able to read and understand a high level description of classes and properties of the dataset provided by a website (SPARQL endpoint) in order to write a query. SEE page 3.

--------------

COMPETENCY: Is able to glean a sense of what properties are used in a dataset by directly exploring the RDF. SEE page 9.

--------------

COMPETENCY: Uses an exploratory query to gain a sense of the types of data for which you can query a dataset. SEE page 5.  

EXAMPLE: select distinct ?Concept where {[] a ?Concept}

--------------

COMPETENCY: If available, uses an Ontology browsing interface to explore the ontologies used in a particular dataset.   

EXAMPLE: eagle-i (https://search.eagle-i.net/model/).

--------------

COMPETENCY: Is able to pull data from different SPARQL endpoints in one single SPARQL query using the SERVICE directive.
