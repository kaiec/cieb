This week - review of competency index

-- https://docs.google.com/document/d/1i1k5kZLWncb3dJozb61SQiRS7hljUAox-gEXs4gHs7o
   Many people have viewed Google Doc of the Competency Index 
   though not many have left comments.  We should discuss those comments 
   on the call.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Gap analysis (Sean)

-- Sean will present his work analyzing gaps in available learning 
   resources.  What insights can we get from this for identifying gaps
   in the Competency Index?

-- https://github.com/ld4pe/cieb/blob/master/CompIndex/ScratchPad.md
   Please add notes or ideas to the ScratchPad -- or simply note gaps 
   that need to be addressed.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Definitions needed (Sean)

-- Sean will make a case for adding definitions to clarify the meaning
   of certain headings.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Workflow for generating Google Docs (Tom)

-- See https://github.com/ld4pe/ld4pe-general/issues/40
   By November, we need to have defined a reasonable workflow for 
   collecting feedback and maintaining the Competency Index.  For 
   this week's call, please look at the technical issue and Stuart's 
   thoughtful response.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Wrapping up CIEB work by end-June?

-- Tom proposes that we hold one meeting every three weeks between now 
   and the end of June which works out to about six meetings.  After that, we 
   enter the summer months and by September we will already be in the last
   weeks of the LD4PE Project.

   * Dates
   * Goals by end-June
   * Competency Index maintenance after LD4PE
