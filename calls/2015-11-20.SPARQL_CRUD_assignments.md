#SPARQL/CRUD ASSIGNMENTS
It was difficult to find resources devoted solely to the topic of CRUD operations using SPARQL, so some of these 
resources only have a few slides/pages/paragraphs which are relevant. A few of them only approach the topic tangentially, but 
hopefully we can glean some competencies from them anyway.
