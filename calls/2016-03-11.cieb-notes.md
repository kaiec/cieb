Public review of Competency Index

-- https://docs.google.com/document/d/1i1k5kZLWncb3dJozb61SQiRS7hljUAox-gEXs4gHs7o

__Stuart__: Status: We need to finalize what is here for the next 
version.  Hoping we have no more than two major updates between 
here and June.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Gaps in the Competency Index - and what to do about them

Stuart will explain that ASN will not publish a competency index until it is 
considered "complete" (or complete enough).  Please study the current CI for 
a discussion of which parts _must_ be filled in for the index to be complete 
enough -- and which parts we might consider dropping for the final release.

See Competency Index (above) plus:
-- Sean's "1-to-5" ratings of how well specific topics are covered in the index
   https://github.com/ld4pe/cieb/blob/master/calls/2016-03-11.resource_representation_jan2016.pdf


__Stuart__: Two issues:
* where do we not have competencies (at all)?
* where are there gaps in the resources?

Nothing for:
* Web technology
* Linked Data principles
* Linked Data architectures and services

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Contacting "prolific" authors

On the February 19 call, we discussed the idea of writing to the some of the
authors of resources indexed by LD4PE, saying (roughly) "we indexed your video
X using the competencies Y and Z" and asking them to comment on the Competency
Index.

Goal: decide on process for approaching some authors, with a follow-up 
schedule.

-- Scratch Pad for notes on gaps, people to contact

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Scope Notes for the Topic Index

-- https://github.com/ld4pe/cieb/blob/master/calls/2016-03-11.TopicVocab-definitions.txt
   On the call, we will look at each heading for which Sean raised a 
   question and decide on what a scope note should say (to be wordsmithed
   offline).
