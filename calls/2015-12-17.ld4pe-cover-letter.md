Subject: LD4PE/CIEB calls in January / February / March<br>

Dear Members of the Competency Index Editorial Board,

Since postponing the November 27 call I have been largely out of
commission with pneumonia and am only now catching up.  

I'd like to schedule the next three calls for January, February, and
March.  I'm assuming for now that 16:00 (Central European time) on
Fridays will continue to work for everyone?  Please indicate your
availability at [1].

I suggest we pick up exactly where we left off in late November.  Our
discussion should be better because everyone will have had plenty of
time to do the assignments :-)

Rather than send everything to your mailboxes again, let me point 
you to the documents on Github:

* your assignments to review competencies related to SPARQL "CRUD" 
  features [2].  Any competencies you formulate after reviewing 
  your assigned readings should be posted by editing and committing 
  the assignment document [2] -- have a look at how Sean and Debbie 
  have done this.

* the agenda for the November 27 call [3] with its cover letter [4].
  Recall that we had three objectives for the November call:
   
   * Primary objective: take one final, critical look at the
     SPARQL-related competencies we previously approved [5].
     For example, I suggest we drop the competency related to 
     the BGP for reasons I outline in the note below; and you 
     may find other issues.

   * Secondary objective: the SPARQL/CRUD competencies.  We 
     should at least decide on the number, nature, and scope of 
     these competencies.  Exact wordings can then be refined 
     offline for final approval on the next call, in February.
   
   * Time permitting: We should have a first look at some draft 
     competencies related to "RDF Fundamentals" [6].  Sean has pulled
     together a list of resources about RDF "in general", but there
     are so many introductions to RDF that it doesn't seem very 
     efficient to assign these for review.  Rather, we are all 
     expert enough in RDF that we can formulate competencies simply
     on the basis of our own "competency".  Stuart refers to 
     this as the principle of "expert warrant".

In other words, two or three hours to review your assigned readings on
SPARQL/CRUD; another half hour to formulate some competencies and
propose them by editing CompIndex-draft.md; another half hour to give
the previous SPARQL competencies a final critical reading (and note any
doubts or issues); and an hour or so to make a careful reading of 
the draft competencies on "RDF fundamentals".

Inexplicably, the DC-REVIEW mailing list is still not working right, and
we haven't had time to study the settings or contact JISCMAIL support,
so for now we should continue to communicate by direct email to the CIEB
members (Sean, Tom, Stuart, Kai, Magnus, Debbie).

Have restful holidays; I look forward to catching up with you all in the
new year!

Tom

Subject: LD4PE/CIEB Friday call - postponed<br>

Dear all,

I am unwell and must postpone tomorrow's call.

This is perhaps just as well, as it will give everyone extra time to
complete their assignments [1] :-)

In the meantime, we could perhaps do our "final check" of the SPARQL 
competencies [2] on this list.  With just minor edits, these are based on the 
competencies we discussed waaay back in September [3,4].  Looking at them
again today with fresh eyes, several things jump out, one of which is:

    Understands the "basic graph pattern" (BGP) of a SPARQL query as a
    set of triple patterns.

This _sounds_ pretty basic, like the competency that follows it, but the
specific language construct "BGP" is actually an advanced feature of SPARQL,
and one that I'm not convinced we need to cover.  I suggest dropping this.

There are also some cases where "competencies" (marked "[C]") actually seem
more like benchmarks (marked "[D]").  Post your comments here!  I will
start a thread by re-posting my comment.

I will post a Doodle poll when I am feeling better.
