  * June 24   - regrets: Debbie

======================================================================
Gaps and corrections

* http://tinyurl.com/ld4pe-competencies-may13
  
  I would like to walk through this latest printout on the call,
  making some corrections immediately and noting where there are 
  gaps to be filled.

* Non-RDF linked data (note the lowercase)

  Topic Maps - Sam Oh?
  Microdata - syntactically different from RDF
  Graph databases, such as Neo4j.

__Stuart__: Entered changes in ASN.  Have to make some SKOS 
changes.  Then I tell Joseph it is ready and this triggers the 
update with Abbie.  Plan is to make any changes we agree here
over the weekend, then update on Monday.

__Tom__: Want to delete "Understands the use of RDF Schema..." 
because it is redundant with "RDF Vocabularies" -> "Designing 
RDF vocabularies".

__DECISION__: Move "Uses portals and registries to find..." - 
elevate to competency under "Finding RDF-based vocabularies".
Add a benchmark for LOV.

__Stuart__: Prefer that we leave "Versioning RDF Data" for now.
Also "Assessing RDF data quality" (even if it is empty when we 
go to Version 1).

__Stuart__: Hope that by end-June, we can say we have Version 1.

======================================================================
GAP list

* RDF data analytics
* Storing RDF data
  * SPARQL endpoints
  * Triple stores

ACTIONS

* Tom
  * generate new Google Doc
  * send Google Doc address to Mike Lauruhn. Add: We do not think that it is
    appropriate to classify competencies by proficiency level (Beginner, etc).
    However, we _do_ think it is appropriate to classify particular resources
    by level.
  * prepare diff that Stuart can use to edit new version of CI
  * add full stops to the end of each competency and prepare separate diff
  * propose approach using Github for long-term community-driven maintenance of
    CI.
  * self: remind Tom Johnson to review Ruby competencies
  * John Kunze: one competency on management of ARKs?
  * create list of issues and gaps
  * competencies on topic maps (Sam)?

* Debbie
  * contact advisor about competencies for "temporarily indexed data" (and
    looking at the CI in general)
  * ask Ryan for competencies re: period identifiers for temporally indexed
    data, with a link to PERIODO work.

* Stuart:
  * write Diane re: cleaning data
  * go back to Euclid project re: LD Application Architecture
  * SPARQL endpoints and triple stores (will ask Joseph Chapman)
  * ping Seth and Ruben
  * check whether http://explore.dublincore.net/comp-index/ will continue to be maintained

* Kai
  * write provenance competency about differentiating simple approach and
    representing the chain

* Sean:
