     Fundamentals of Linked Data
         Web technology
         -- Q: Is this a catch all for "Semantic Web"?
         Linked Data principles
         Linked Data architectures and services
         -- Q: Using LD, but not RDF?
         Linked data policies and best practices
         Non-RDF Linked Data
         -- Q: Schema.org, Microdata, Rich Snippets?

     RDF vocabularies and application profiles
         Finding RDF-based vocabularies
         Maintaining RDF vocabularies
         Versioning RDF vocabularies
         Publishing RDF vocabularies
         Mapping RDF vocabularies
         RDF application profiles

     Creating and Transforming Linked Data
         Managing identifiers (URI)
         Creating RDF data
         Versioning RDF data
         RDF data provenance
         Cleaning and reconciling RDF data
         Mapping and enriching RDF data

     Interacting with Linked Data
         Programming RDF data
         -- Q: What does this mean?  Any use of RDF which involves Python, Ruby, etc?
         Querying RDF data
         Visualizing RDF data
         Reasoning over RDF
         -- Q: Inferencing: leveraging both OWL and RDF Schema?
            But, how to distinguish this from crossing over into the "Designing
            RDF Vocabularies" and/or "Querying RDF Vocabularies".  Should catalogers be
            instructed to err on the side of filing resources under all three?

         -- Q: Using RDF data for analytics (Data Science)?

     Creating Linked Data applications
         Storing RDF data
         Linked Data application architecture
         -- Q: Applications developed for widespread and long-term use.  
            Need to make difference between this and "Linked Data 
            architectures and services" clear - scale?
         Linked Data mashups
         -- Q: Created for one time or limited use (e.g., an interactive map or graph).
         Finding RDF data
         Manipulating RDF data
         Designing RDF-based vocabularies
