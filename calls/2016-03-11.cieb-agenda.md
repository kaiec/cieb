[3/9/16, 2:53:51 PM] Thomas Baker: -- gap analysis
[3/9/16, 2:54:19 PM] Thomas Baker: -- Sean's RDF cataloging tool (quick demo and feedback) - good use of 15 minutes?

[3/9/16, 3:00:12 PM] Thomas Baker: also - Sean produced documents with names of "prolific" authors
[3/9/16, 3:00:18 PM] Thomas Baker: so another agenda point:
[3/9/16, 3:00:42 PM] Thomas Baker: -- people to approach (ScratchPad.md, and Sean's documents) - and process for following up

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Competency index

-- Public review
   https://docs.google.com/document/d/1i1k5kZLWncb3dJozb61SQiRS7hljUAox-gEXs4gHs7o

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Gaps in the Competency Index - and what to do about them

Stuart will explain that ASN will not publish a competency index until it is 
considered "complete" (or complete enough).  Please study the current CI for 
a discussion of which parts _must_ be filled in for the index to be complete 
enough -- and which parts we might consider dropping for the final release.

Relevant data:
-- Sean's "1-to-5" ratings of how well specific topics are covered in the index
   https://github.com/ld4pe/cieb/blob/master/calls/2016-03-11.resource_representation_jan2016.pdf

Scratch Pad where 
   https://github.com/ld4pe/cieb/blob/master/calls/ScratchPad.md
   Please add notes or ideas to the ScratchPad -- or simply note gaps 
   that need to be addressed.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Contacting "prolific" authors

On the February 19 call, we discussed the idea of writing to the some of the
authors of resources indexed by LD4PE, saying (roughly) "we indexed X using the
competencies Y and Z" and asking them to comment on the Competency Index.

Could write to a few of them if we had a list of resources indexed along with
competencies addressed.  Could contact them, ask to comment on CI draft.  Main
obstacle: would have to dig out their email address.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Scope Notes for the Topic Index

-- https://github.com/ld4pe/cieb/blob/master/calls/2016-03-11.TopicVocab-definitions.txt
   On the call, we will look at each heading for which Sean raised a 
   question and decide on what a scope note should say (to be wordsmithed
   offline).
