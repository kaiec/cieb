B Querying RDF Data
C Understands the "basic graph pattern" (BGP) of a SPARQL query as a set of triple patterns
C Understands that the most basic SPARQL query matches the triples of an RDF graph against a triple pattern consisting of fixed and variable values
C Understands the role of punctuation in a SPARQL query
D Uses angle brackets for delimiting URIs
D Uses question marks for indicating variables
C Formulates advanced queries on data containing blank nodes
C Uses PREFIX for URIs in SPARQL queries
C Demonstrates a working knowledge of the forms and uses of SPARQL result sets (SELECT, CONSTRUCT, DESCRIBE, and ASK)
C Understands how to combine and filter graph patterns using operators such as UNION, OPTIONAL, FILTER, and MINUS
C Understands the major SPARQL result set modifiers, e.g., to limit or sort results, or to return distinct results only once
C Understands the use of SPARQL functions and operators
C Differentiates between a Default Graph and a Named Graph, and formulates queries using the GRAPH clause
C Formulate advanced queries using subqueries
C Uses a temporary variable to extend a query
C Understands the role of Property Paths and how they are formed by combining predicates with regular expression-like operators
C Understands how to perform Federated Searches
C Converts/manipulates SPARQL query outputs (RDF-XML, JSON) to the exact format required by a third party tools and APIs
C Formulates queries using FROM with URLs and local files
C Reads and understands high-level descriptions of the classes and properties of a dataset in order to write queries 
C Uses available tools, servers, and endpoints to issue queries against a dataset 
B Visualizing RDF Data
C Uses publicly available tools to visualize data
D Uses Google FusionTables to create maps and charts
C Distills results taken from large datasets so that visualizations are human-friendly
C Converts/manipulates SPARQL query outputs (RDF-XML, JSON) to the exact format required by a third party tools and APIs    
B Reasoning over RDF data
B Assessing RDF data quality
B RDF Data analytics
C Uses available ontology browsing tools to explore the ontologies used in a particular dataset    
B Finding RDF data
C Retrieves and accesses RDF data from the "open Web"
C Uses relevant resources to discover existing Linked Data datasets
C Monitors and updates lists which report the status of SPARQL endpoints
C Uses available vocabularies for dataset description to support their discovery
C Registers datasets with relevant services for discovery
B Manipulating RDF Data
C Uses SPARQL functions to create, read, update and delete RDF data
D Uses POST to add triples to an existing graph
D Uses GET to retrieve triples from a default graph or a named graph
D Uses PUT to insert set of triples into a new graph (or replace an existing graph)
D Uses DELETE to remove a graph
D Uses proper syntax to request specific media types, such as Turtle
C Understands the SPARQL Graph Store HTTP protocol for editing graphs on remote servers
C Uses SPARQL to insert, delete, and modify RDF data
