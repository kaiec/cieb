Overview of the process

The process requires

1. A "source editor" (currently Tom), who
   -- understands how the process works,
   -- can edit the source files
   -- can run `make`, which runs the Ruby script, which requires:
      * prior installation of `ruby`
      * prior installation of `pandoc`
   -- can commit files to https://github.com/ld4pe/cieb
   -- can communicate the URL to...

2. A "production editor" (currently Stuart), who
   -- can use ASN to manually update the competency index in the ASN editor
   -- can communicate to...

3. A "webmaster" (currently David or Abi), who 
   -- can update the Competency Index on the Web from the ASN editor

----------------------------------------------------------------------
How the "diff" is prepared (for use in manually updating CI in ASN editor)

  1. Edit CompIndex-stage.txt over a period of hours, days, or weeks.  

     Note: The rationale for editing CompIndex-stage.txt (and not CompIndex.txt) 
     is to make it easy for the editor to keep track of how much the "stage" 
     version is diverging from the last "published" version by using common tools
     such as `vimdiff` and `diff` on the two files within the local copy of the 
     repository.

  2. When CompIndex-stage.txt is ready to be published, copy over CompIndex.txt
     then commit with Github:

    $ cp -vi CompIndex-stage.txt CompIndex.txt
    $ git add CompIndex.txt
    $ git commit -m 'CompIndex.txt - new version for publication'
    $ git push

    Note: By using a committed and pushed version of CompIndex.txt, one can 
    get a "diff" of changes that has its own URL and is formatted nicely, 
    as described in the following steps...

  3. Go to commits page on the Web: https://github.com/ld4pe/cieb/commits/master

  4. Find latest commit (e.g., 'CompIndex.txt - new version...' as above).

  5. Click on its SHA - e.g., 0b03ad0

  6. Copy URL displayed in browser, e.g., 
     https://github.com/ld4pe/cieb/commit/0b03ad068aaf472de22bc763c9706f1600bf4f1d
     and send to Stuart (or whomever is using ASN to update the competency index)

How to generate a new version CompIndex-generated.docx (which is used to create a Google doc)

  1. In your local copy of the 'cieb' repository, go to the directory 
     https://github.com/ld4pe/cieb/tree/master/CompIndex

  2. Check that the file CompIndex.txt is more recent than the file 
     CompIndex-generated.docx.  For example:

     - 2016-05-12  12:10      17008  CompIndex-generated.docx        
     - 2016-05-14  08:28      17833  CompIndex.txt   

  3. Run the command `make`.  This command detects that CompIndex.txt is more 
     recent than CompIndex-generated.docx and runs the following commands:

     1    ruby mkcompindex.rb --source 'CompIndex.txt' --target 'CompIndex-generated.md'
     2    pandoc CompIndex-generated.md -o CompIndex-generated.docx
     3    git add CompIndex-generated.md
     4    git add CompIndex-generated.docx
     5    git commit -m 'generated CompIndex-generated.md and CompIndex-generated.docx'
     
     Explanation:

     1. Runs the Ruby script `mkcompindex.rb`, which takes CompIndex.txt as an input 
        and creates a Markdown file.
     2. Runs `pandoc` to read the Markdown file as output and create a DOCX file (MSWord).
     3. Adds the Markdown file to Git.
     4. Adds the DOCX file to Git.
     5. Commits both files in your _local_ Git repository.

  4. Inspect the results and repeat as necessary.  When the results are satisfactory, 
     commit them to Github with the local command `push`.
